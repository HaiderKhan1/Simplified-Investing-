   <p style="font-family: Parkavenue; font-size:1.5vw;">
     Market Prospect ratios are mainly used by investors to compare publicly traded companies’
     stock prices with other financial measures such as earnings per share and dividend payouts.
     Not only that, market prospect ratios help investors analyze current stock price trends,
     and dividend measurements which they can use to determine future market value of shares.

    <h2> Earnings Per Share (EPS) </h2> <br>
    <p> Measures the amount of money each share of stock would receive if all of the profits were distributed
       to the outstanding shares at the end of the year. It also shows how profitable a company is on a shareholder
       basis. After calculating a higher EPS ratio is better than a lower one as the company is more profitable. </p>

    <p>Shows what the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its current earnings. Investors
       use the P/E ratio to evaluate a stock’s fair market value by predicting future earnings per share.
       Furthermore, it also allows investors to analyze how much they should pay for a stock based on its current
       earnings. A company with a high P/E ratio indicates positive future performance and growth, and a low P/E
       ratio indicated poor performance and future growth.  </p>

       Furthermore, when analyzing a high payout ratio is good; however, a consistent trend
       in this ratio is more important. Therefore, calculate this ratio for multiple years and analyze

    <h2> Dividend Payout Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>The dividend yield is a financial ratio that measures the amount of cash dividends distributed
      to common shareholders relative to the market value per share. Moreover, investors can use the
      dividend yield formula to analyze their return on investments in stocks, and know how much dividends
      they are getting for every dollar that the stock is worth. When analyzing, a high dividend yield pays
      it’s investors a large dividend compared to the fair market value. It is also important to understand
      that this ratio varies in different industries i.e tech industries rarely pay dividends.   </p>
