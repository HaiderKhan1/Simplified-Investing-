   Solvency ratios measure a company’s ability to sustain operations and pay its liabilities
   in the long term by comparing debt levels with equity, assets and earnings. Additionally,
   solvency ratios show a company’s ability to make payments and pay off its long term obligations,
   better ratios indicate that a company is financially stable.

    <h2> Debt to Equity Ratio </h2> <br>
    <p>
  This ratio shows the percentage of a company’s financing that comes from creditors and investors.
  Furthermore, a higher debt to equity ratio indicates that most of the company’s financing comes
  from creditors (loans) than investor financing (shareholders). A lower debt to equity ratio indicates
  a company is more financially stable, whereas company’s with a higher debt to equity ratio are considered
  risky as their debts need to be paid back to creditors.

    <h2> Equity Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures the amount of assets that are financed by owners' investments and through investors
      by comparing the total equity in the company to total assets. Equity ratios emphasizes two imperative
      financial concepts; firstly, it shows how much of the total company assets are owned outright by the
      investors. Secondly,  inversely shows how leveraged the company is with debt. Moreover, higher equity
      ratios are typically favourable for companies as high investment levels from shareholders shows potential
      shareholders that the company is worth investing in.

    <h2> Debt Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>
       Measures a firm’s total liabilities as a percentage of its total assets,
       it shows how many assets the company must sell in order to pay off all of its
       liabilities. The debt ratio is shown in decimal format since it calculates total
       liabilities as a percentage of total assets. Furthermore, a lower ratio is more
       favourable than a higher ratio as it indicates that the company is more stable,
       with a potential for longevity due to a lower overall debt. A debt ratio of 0.5
       is considered less risky than say 1 or higher as it shows the company has twice
       as many assets than liabilities.
