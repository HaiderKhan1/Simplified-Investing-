    What Is Simplified Investing?  
   </h1>
<br>

  <p>
  Simplified Investing is an online tool that you can use to analyze a company’s financial standing
  by computing and understanding financial ratios. Furthermore, these ratios are of great importance
  when analyzing a company as it indicates whether a company is financially stable and how well they perform.
  Simplified Investing is an ongoing project and this version focuses on a hands on market analysis;
  as the user will have input data and determine if the commuted ratios are sufficient for the company
  in the industry. Moreover, we are working hard to develop a recommendation system that will not only
  compute ratios, but also compare them to the industry standards to determine whether the company is worth
  investing, and if the stock is overvalued or undervalued.
