    <h2>Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio </h2> <br>
    <p>Measure how many times a business can turn its accounts receivable into cash during a period.
       Furthermore, this is an imperative ratio as it indicates how efficiently a company is at collecting
       its credit sales from customers. Moreover, a higher accounts receivable turnover ratio
       is more favourable as it shows that the company is collecting their receivables more frequently throughout the year.

    <h2> Assets Turnover Ratio </h2> <br>
    <p> Measures a company’s ability to generate sales from its assets by comparing net
       sales with average total assets. Moreover, a higher assets turnover ratio is more
       favourable as it indicates that the company can effectively use its assets to generate sales.  </p>

    <h2> Inventory Turnover Ratio </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures how efficiently a company can manage its inventory and turn it or sell it during a period.
      Furthermore, it is imperative that the company should have a high inventory turnover ratio as it indicates
      that the company does not overspend by buying too much inventory. Not only that, it shows that the company
      can effectively sell the inventory it buys.  </p>

    <h2>Day's Sales In Inventory Ratio:  </h2> <br>
    <p> Measures the number of days it will take a company to sell all of its inventory. Furthermore,
      this is an important ratio as it measures value, liquidity and cash flows; as it shows investors
      and creditors how valuable a company’s inventory is as newer inventory is worth more than older ones.
      Moreover, it is more favourable that inventory is sold in less days to minimize costs and make sure
      inventory moves as fast as possible to generate cash flow. Otherwise,  it can start costing the company
      extra money if it sits for longer.   </p>
