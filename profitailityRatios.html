 Profitability ratios compare income statement accounts and categories to show a company’s
 ability to generate profits from its operations. Furthermore, investors and creditors can use
 profitability ratios to judge a company’s ROI based on its levels of resources and assets.

    <h2> Return on Equity Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures the ability of a company to generate profits from the investments of its shareholders.
       Furthermore, this ratio is imperative when analyzing a company’s financial standing from an investors
       perspective as it indicates how profit each dollar of common stockholders’ equity generates. Moreover,
       this being said it is always preferable to have a high return on equity because it shows that the
       company is using the investors capital effectively. However, the ROE ratio varies in each industry
       and it should be used to compare companies in the same industry.  </p>

    <h2> Gross Profit Margin </h2> <br>
    <p> Measures how profitable a company is by selling its inventory of merchandise.
        Furthermore, a higher ratio is more favourable as it indicates that the company
        is selling their inventory at a higher profit percentage. Not only that, companies
        with a higher gross profit percentage means that the company will have more money
        to pay operating expenses. </p>

    <h2> Profit Margin </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar of sales generated by comparing the net
      income and net sales of a company. Furthermore, creditors and investors utilize the profit margin
      ratio to check whether the company can effectively convert sales into net income. Additionally,
      since the profit margin ratio measures a company’s ability to manage its expenses relative to its
      net sales, a higher profit margin is always more favourable.  </p>

    <h2> Return on Assets Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p> Indicated how profitable a company’s assets are as it measures how efficiently a company can
      manage its assets to produce profits during a period. Furthermore, a higher return on assets
      ratio is highly imperative as it shows that the company is more effectively managing its assets
      to produce greater amounts of net income.   </p>
