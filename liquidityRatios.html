   <p style="font-family: Parkavenue; font-size:1.5vw;">
  Liquidity ratios show how much cash a business has and their ability to turn other assets into
  cash to pay off both its current and future liabilities as they come due. Furthermore, liquidity
  ratios are also a measure of how easily a company can raise cash or convert other assets into cash.

    <h2> Quick Ratio </h2> <br>
    <p>
      Measures the ability of a company to pay its current liabilities when they come due with
      only quick assets which are current assets such as marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents.
      Higher quick ratios are imperative for companies as it shows the company is generating enough quick assets
      (cash) to cover current liabilities. Moreover, a quick ratio of 1 shows that quick assets equal current
      liabilities. Additionally, a quick ratio of over 1 will show there are quick assets leftover after paying
      current liabilities.

    <h2> Working Capital / Current Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures the firm's ability to pay off its short term liabilities which are due
       within the next year with its current assets. Additionally, the current ratio helps
        investors and creditors understand the liquidity of a company and their ability to
        pay off current liabilities. A higher current ratio is always more favourable as it
        shows the company can easily pay off its current liabilities. Moreover, a ratio of
        2 means that the company will have 2 times more current assets than current liabilities.

    <h2> Times Interest Earned Ratio  </h2> <br>
    <p>Measures the proportionate amount of income that can be used to cover interest expenses in the future.
       Furthermore, the ratio indicates how many times a company could pay the interest with income before it's
       taxed, thus a larger ratio is more preferable. A ratio of 2 means that the company makes enough income to
       pay for itâ€™s interest expense two times over.  </p>
